# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Session Creation (Admin)

Admin clicks START SESSION button

A new live session is created in the database with:

type = "admin"

unique_id = <randomly generated UUID>

userurl = <auto-generated session link>

A video player is displayed on screen after session creation (with Play, Pause, Volume, Fullscreen etc.)

Session Access (Student/User)

When the userurl is opened in any browser/tab

The same video player loads automatically

The session is linked using the stored unique_id

Student also has full playback controls

Database Structure

Database: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
Collection: live_sessions

Field	Type	Description
_id	ObjectId	Auto generated primary key
type	String	admin or student
unique_id	String	UUID assigned to session
userurl	String	URL students can join with

Data is stored in MongoDB, not locally.

Example stored document:

{
  "_id": "67ab1e312fcaf34c8a81b294",
  "type": "admin",
  "unique_id": "f4c1b9d1-72c5-44e1-91aa-3f2d6b20add3",
  "userurl": "http://localhost:3000/session/f4c1b9d1-72c5-44e1-91aa-3f2d6b20add3"
